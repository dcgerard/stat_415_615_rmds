# What is linear regression?

- Fitting lines and planes through clouds of points.

# What can you use it for?

- Detecting trends.
    - Easy to see trends if you have two variables. Harder if you have more.
    - Linear regression allows us to say "folks that have bigger x tend to have bigger y".

- Control for other variables.

# Generality

- Many statistical procedures are special cases of (or approximations to) linear regression.

## $t$-test

```{r}
## t-test p-value
t.test(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars, var.equal = TRUE)$p.value

## linear regression p-value
lmout <- lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
coef(summary(lmout))["am", "Pr(>|t|)"]
```

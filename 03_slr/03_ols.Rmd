# Learning Objectives

- Understand least squares objective and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates.
- Derive OLS estimates using matrix notation.

# Data

- Consider the "bread and peace" data from Chapter 7 of [ROS](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/).

    ```{r, message=FALSE}
    library(readr)
    library(ggplot2)
    hibbs <- read_csv("../data/hibbs.csv")
    qplot(x = growth, y = vote, data = hibbs)
    ```

# Visualization
    
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

# Introduction

- R is a statistical programming language designed to analyze data.

- This is not an R course. But you need to know some tools to summarize/plot/model data.

- R is free, widely used, more generally applicable (beyond linear regression), and a useful tool for reproducibility. So this is what we will use.

- Python would have been a good choice too, but you can learn that in the machine learning course (STAT 427/627).

# Installation

- Install here R : <https://cran.r-project.org/>

- Install R Studio here: <https://www.rstudio.com/>

- NOTE: R is a programming language. R Studio is an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), a program for interacting with programming language (specifically R in this case). Thus, on your resume, you should say that you know R, *not* R Studio.

# Before we begin

- I cannot teach you everything there is to know in R. When you
know the name of a function, but don't know the commands, use
the `help()` function. For example, to learn more about `log()` type

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    help(log)
    ```

- Alternatively, if you do not know the name of the function, you can
Google the functionality you want. Googling coding solutions is a
lot of what real data scientists do. Just append what you are Googling with "in R". So, for example, "linear mixed effects models in R".

# R Basics

- When you first open up R Studio, it should look something like this

  ![](./00_figures/rstudio_1.png)\ 
  
- The area to the right of the carrot "`>`" is called a **prompt**. You insert commands into the prompt.

- You can use R as a powerful calculator. Try typing some of the following into the command prompt:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    3 * 7
    9 / 3
    4 + 6
    3 - 9
    (3 + 5) * 6
    3 ^ 2
    4 ^ 2
    ```

- R consists of two things: variables and functions (computer scientists would probably disagree with
this categorization).

## Variables

- A variable stores a value. You use the **assignment operator** "`<-`" to assign values to variables. For example, we can assign the value of `10` to the variable `x`.

    ```{r}
    x <- 10
    ```
    
    - It is possible to use `=`, and I think there is nothing wrong with that. But for some reason the field has decided to only use `<-`, so you should too.
    
- Whenever we use `x` later, it will use the value of 10

    ```{r}
    x
    ```
    
- This is useful because you can reuse this value over and over again:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    y <- 0
    x + y
    x * y
    x / y
    x - y
    ```

- To assign a "string" (a fancy way to say a word) to `x`, put the string in quotes. For example, we can assing the value of `"Hello World"` to `x`.

    ```{r}
    x <- "Hello World"
    x
    ```

## Functions

- Functions take objects (such as numbers or variables) as input and output
  new objects. Let's look at a 
  simple function that takes the log of a number:
  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    log(x = 4, base = 2)
    ```
  
- The inputs are called "arguments". Generally, every function will be for the
  form:
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    function_name(arg1 = val1, arg2 = val2, ...)
    ```

- If you do not specify the name of the argument, R will assume you are 
  assigning in their order.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    log(4, 2)
    ```

- You can change the order of the arguments if you specify them.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    log(base = 2, x = 4)
    ```

- To see the list of all possible arguments of a function, use the `help()` 
  function:
  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    help(log)
    ```

- In the help file, there are often **default** values for an argument. For 
  example, the following indicates the the default value of `base` is `exp(1)`.
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    log(x, base = exp(1))
    ```
  
- This indicates that you can omit the `base` argument and R will assume that 
  it should be `exp(1)`.
  
    ```{r}
    log(x = 4, base = exp(1))
    log(x = 4)
    ```

- If an argument does not have a default, then it must be specified when calling a function.
  
- Type this:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    log(x = 4,
    ```

- The "`+`" indicates that R is expecting more input (you forgot either a
  parentheses or a quotation mark). You can get back to the prompt by hitting
  the ESCAPE key.

- A **package** is a collection of functions that don't come with R by default.

- There are **many many** packages available. If you need to do any data
  analysis, there is probably an R package for it.

- Using `install.packages()`, you can install packages that contain functions 
  and datasets that are not available by default. Do this now with the 
  tidyverse package:
  
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    install.packages("tidyverse")
    ```

- You will only need to install a package once per computer. Once it is 
  installed you can gain access to all of the functions and datasets in a
  package by using the `library()` function. 
  
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    library(tidyverse)
    ```

- You will need to run `library()` at the start of every R session if you 
  want to use the functions in a package.
  
- When I want to write the name of a function, I will write it like `this()`.

# Data Frames

- The fundamental unit object of data analysis is the **data frame**.

- A data frame has variables in the columns, and observations in the rows. 

    ![](./00_figures/dataframe.png){width=50%}\ 
    
- R comes with a bunch of famous datasets in the form of a data frame. Such as the `mtcars` dataset.

    ```{r}
    data("mtcars")
    mtcars
    ```
    
- You can explore these in a spreadsheet format using `View()` (note the capital "V").

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    View(mtcars)
    ```

## Reading in Data Frames

- Most datasets will nead to be loaded into R. To do so, we will use the `{readr}` package.

    ```{r}
    library(readr)
    ```

- The only function I will require you to know from this package is `read_csv()`, which loads in data from a [CSV file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) ("Comma-separated values"), a very popular format for storing data.

- If you have the CSV file somewhere on your computer, then specify the pack from the current working directory, and assign the data frame to a variable.

- For other file formats, you need to use other functions, such as `read_tsv()`, `read_table()`, `read_fwf()`, etc. I will try to make sure `read_csv()` works for all datasets in this course.

# Basic Data Frame Manipulations

- You will need to know just a few data frame manipulations, which we will perform using the `{dplyr}` package.

    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(dplyr)
    ```

- Use the `mutate()` function from the `{dplyr}` package to make variable transformations.
    
- Use `glimpse()` to get a brief look at the data frame.

- Use `View()` to see a spreadsheet of the data frame (never put this in an R Markdown file). Note the capital "V".

- Use `rename()` to rename variables.

- Use `filter()` to remove rows.

# Summary

- `help()`: Open help file.

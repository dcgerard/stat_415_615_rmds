# Introduction

- R Markdown is a file format that is a combination of plain text and R code.

- A free book on R Markdown is available here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/

- You write code and commentary of code in one file. You may then compile 
  (RStudio calls this "Knitting") the R Markdown file to many different kinds
  of output: pdf (including beamer presentations), html (including various
  presentation formats), Word, PowerPoint, etc.

- R Markdown is useful for:

    1. Communication of statistical results.
    2. Collaborating with other data scientists.
    3. Using it as a modern lab notebook to *do* data science.
    
- *You will use R Markdown for all assignments in this class.*

## Installing R Markdown

- You can install R Markdown from CRAN:
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    install.packages("rmarkdown")
    ```
    
- To make PDF files, you will need to install \LaTeX\ if you don't have it 
  already. To install it, type in R:
    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    install.packages("tinytex")
    tinytex::install_tinytex()
    ```
    
- If you get an error while trying to install tinytex, try manually 
  installing \LaTeX\ instead:
    - For Windows users, go to <http://miktex.org/download>
    - For OS users, go to <https://tug.org/mactex/>
    - For Linux users, go to <https://www.tug.org/texlive/>
    
## Playing with R Markdown

- Open up a new R Markdown file:

![](./00_figures/rmarkdown.png)\ 

- Choose the options for the type of output you want

![](./00_figures/rmarkdown_options.png)\ 


- You should now have a rudimentary R Markdown file.

- Save a copy of this file in your "analysis" folder in the "week1" project.

- R Markdown contains three things

    1. A YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) header that controls options for
       the R Markdown document. These are surrounded by `---`.
    2. Code **chunks** --- bits of R code that that are 
       surrounded by ` ```{r} ` and ` ``` `. Only valid R code should go in 
       here.
    3. Plain text that contains simple formatting options.
    
- All of these are are displayed in the default R Markdown file. You can compile
  this file by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of the screen or by 
  typing CONTROL + SHIFT + K. Do this now.
    
### Formatting markdown

- Here is Hadley's brief intro to formatting text in R Markdown:

    ```{r, comment="", echo=FALSE}
    cat(readr::read_file("./formatting.md"))
    ```

### Code Chunks

- You can insert new code-chunks using CONTROL + ALT + I (or using the 
  "Insert" button at the top of RStudio).

- You write all R code in chunks. You can send the current line of R code (the
  line where the cursor is) using CONTROL + ENTER (or the "Run" button at the 
  top of RStudio).
  
- You can run all of the code in a chunk using CONTROL + ALT + C (or using 
  the "Run" button at the top of RStudio).
  
- You can run all of the code in the next chunk using CONTROL + ALT + N (or
  using the "Run" button at the top of RStudio).


### YAML Header

- My typical YAML header will looks like this

    ```{r, comment="", echo=FALSE}
    cat(readr::read_file("./yaml_header.Rmd"))
    ```

- All of those settings are fairly self-explanatory.

- The full list of outputs supported is here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html
    
- The `` `r knitr::inline_expr("Sys.Date()")` `` will insert the current date.

### Inline R Code

- Sometimes, you want to write the output of some R code inline (rather than
as the output of some chunk). You can do this by placing code within 
`` `r knitr::inline_expr("")` ``. 

- I used this in the previous section for automatically writing the date. 

    ```{r}
    my_name <- "David"
    ```

- Then "my name is `` `r knitr::inline_expr("my_name")` ``" will result in "my name is `r my_name`".

- For a more realistic example, you might calculate the $p$-value from a linear
  regression, then write this $p$-value in the paragraph of a report.
